# Sketchpad-Python-and-Tkinter-
A sketchpad i made with Python and Tkinter Module

This is a simple project i've been working for a week, it's a simple drawing app.
I will try to update it as soon as i can

PD: You will need the following modules:
import  tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk
from tkinter.colorchooser import *
from tkinter import messagebox
from PIL import ImageGrab
